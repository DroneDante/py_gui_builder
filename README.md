# The gui builder for python

This project is in a beta section. There are currently no releases, but they will come soon. 
I would appreciate, if you contribute. All contributers are welcome!

## The functionality

I want to implement the following festures:

- Export gui to python
- Save and Load the GUI as json
- Settings for each control element
- Etc.
